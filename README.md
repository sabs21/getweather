Goals for Functionality:
- Adding a recent searches tab with animated blocks to visually indicate what the weather was like x minutes ago.
- Animating the page based on weather conditions.
- Adding more weather info, like cloudiness or high/low temperature.
- Adding tablet and mobile support.

Goals for UI:
- Keeping a clean UI thats absent of clutter in order to streamline the user experience.
- Will likely reorganise the UI to make room for new functionality.
